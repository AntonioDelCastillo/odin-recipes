# odin-recipes
Project where I make the first webpage about recipes

The main task in this project is to apply all the knowledge I gathered through the first lessons, such as:

-Heading format
-Basic formatting (Bold, cursive, underline)
-Ordered and unordered lists
-Add images to a website
-Add links to external websites

We will try to keep this first web pretty simple in order to improve it later using CSS
