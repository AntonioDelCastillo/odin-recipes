    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who lived in the peaceful Shire. He was known for his love of good food and his particular fondness for tea cakes. Bilbo's tea cakes were a special treat that he made for his friends and family. They were a delicious blend of butter, sugar, and spices, and were baked to perfection in Bilbo's own oven. Whenever Bilbo had guests over for tea, he would always serve his famous tea cakes as a special treat. His friends and family couldn't get enough of them, and they became a beloved tradition in the Baggins household. </p>
